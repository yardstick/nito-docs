# Introduction

Welcome to the Nito API! You can use our API to manage all aspects of your items, banks, forms, and exams.

We have examples using curl in a bash which you can view in the dark area to the right.

Nito uses GraphQL for its API, and the endpoint is https://api.nito.rapidlms.com/graphql. All requests must be `POST` requests.
